Tidy: Make sure each column in your data is a variable and each row in your data is an observeration. Transform: Filter your data to specific observations, mutate existing columns into new columns, and summarize data. Visualize: Visualization is an important component of data exploration, but usually isn’t very useful for automated processes. Model: Once you know what you’re asking, you can use a model to answer those questions. Models tend to scale well. Communicate: Communication is a critical part of data science! It doesn’t matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them. Program: Programming can aid the entire process, and unlock things that wouldn’t be possible to determine by hand.

It takes care of many of the fiddly details that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics.” © Hadley Wickham 2013 The {ggplot2} package is one of the {tidyverse} packages, it lets us build up plots layer by layer.

Let’s start with making an empty plot: ggplot() + geom_blank() The ggplot() function can be used by adding data inside the function as its first argument, and adding a mapping as a second argument: ggplot( data = &lt; some data &gt; , mapping = aes( x = x , y = y )) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;() "],["geometry.html", "3.3 Geometry", " 3.3 Geometry There are several different types of of &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;: geom_ point (scatterplot) line smooth histogram / bar or (stat_count) / col boxplot map text … "],["aesthetic-mappings.html", "3.4 Aesthetic mappings", " 3.4 Aesthetic mappings Aesthetics are visual properties of objects in the plot.

A super common error: Trying to set the color inside the aes call results in random effects because aes() automatically figures out the necessary scale for your data. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = &quot;blue&quot;)) "],["common-problems.html", "3.5 Common problems", " 3.5 Common problems What is very important when deciding on a visualization of your data?

For example, geom_bar(aes(x = cut)) calculates a count for each cut. ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut)) stat_*() functions do this calculation. ?stat_count (etc) has a Computer variables section that tells you what that stat computes. You can use these computed variables to make fancier plots. 3.6.3 Position adjustments Geoms have a position argument to tell it how to deal with things that go on top of one another. Sample values include “stack”, “identity”, “fill”, “dodge”, and “jitter”. geom_jitter() is a shortcut for geom_point(position = \"jitter\") because it’s super useful. dat &lt;- tibble( x = rep(1:3, 3), y = rep(1:3, 3) ) ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_jitter() Use width and height arguments of geom_jitter to more specifically specify range. ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.5) 3.6.4 Coordinate systems Add Coordinate systems to your ggplot with: coord_flip() coord_quickmap() coord_polar() coord_fixed() By default, {ggplot} uses coord_cartesian() but you can add other functions: coord_flip() can be useful to quickly flip orientations (although this is less necessary in modern {ggplot} than when this book was written; now there’s an “orientation” argument that is usually guessed properly if you leave it blank) coord_quickmap() does proper transformations to work with lat/long data. coord_polar() for circular plots, which are almost always a bad idea but they tend to look cool coord_fixed() set the same limits to both axis 3.6.5 Theme Once your data are imported, tidied and transformed adeguately for obtaing desired visualization you can start setting up a plot with extra features: ?theme It is possible to add a theme() function to your ggplot, this is done to customize the non-data components of your plots: titles labels fonts background gridlines legends … For example if you would like to customize the background of your plot: ggplot() + geom_blank() + theme(plot.background = element_rect(color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2, fill = &quot;gold&quot;), panel.background = element_rect(color = &quot;grey&quot;, size = 5, fill = &quot;darkblue&quot;)) Or you can customize a theme_, there are many different themes provided by defauld by ggplo2 such as: theme_classic() theme_minimal() theme_void() just to name a few, those function then can be further customize by adding the theme customization function.

What is a relation? It is when a primary key and the corresponding foreign key in another table form a relation. What are the types of keys: A primary key uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. primary key: each row is an observation For example, planes$tailnum is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each plane in the planes table. A foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, flights$tailnum is a foreign key for the planes table because it appears in the flights table where it matches each flight to a unique plane. A surrogate key is a custom made key where it is possible to identify unique information, such as the number of rows in a table, and it is made if a table lacks a primary key. For example, flights$filghts_id is a surrogate key because it is custom made and uniquely identifies each observation in the flights table.

Unfortunetely, these can all be a bit different. Therefore, we are going to use the {stringr} package to maintain our semantics and work within one package…{tidyverse}! All string functions in {stringr} start with the root str_ making use of the package quite intuitive. str_length(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;R for Data Science&quot;, NA)) ## [1] 1 18 NA Using the RStudio IDE makes using the autocomplete feature quiet simple This is a excellent way to quickly call on a particular {stringr} function! 14.2.2 Combining Strings To combine two or more strings, use str_c() str_c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) ## [1] &quot;xy&quot; str_c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) ## [1] &quot;xyz&quot; You can also add the sep argument to control how the strings are seperated. str_c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, sep = &quot;, &quot;) ## [1] &quot;x, y&quot; Like many other functions in R, if you have missing data, you can add NA. x &lt;- c(&quot;abc&quot;, NA) str_c(&quot;|-&quot;, x, &quot;-|&quot;) ## [1] &quot;|-abc-|&quot; NA str_c(&quot;|-&quot;, str_replace_na(x), &quot;-|&quot;) ## [1] &quot;|-abc-|&quot; &quot;|-NA-|&quot; As shown above, str_c() is vectorised, and it automatically recycles shorter vectors to the same length as the longest: str_c(&quot;prefix-&quot;, c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), &quot;-suffix&quot;) ## [1] &quot;prefix-a-suffix&quot; &quot;prefix-b-suffix&quot; &quot;prefix-c-suffix&quot; I’m unsure if the use of recycle is accurate in the above statement. Another way to view this is a vector list inside a vector list. As the output is sent to the screen, the function acts like a for-loop inside a for-loop where each pass of the inside combination is iterated as combined with the outside combination iteration. Objects of length 0 are silently dropped. This is particularly useful in conjunction with if: name &lt;- &quot;Ryan&quot; time_of_day &lt;- &quot;afternon&quot; birthday &lt;- FALSE str_c( &quot;Good &quot;, time_of_day, &quot; &quot;, name, if (birthday) &quot; and HAPPY BIRTHDAY&quot;, &quot;.&quot; ) ## [1] &quot;Good afternon Ryan.&quot; The above example is written a bit confusing. The object birthday is passed as a boolean value of FALSE and therefore will never evaluate TRUE, making the if statement overhead. Maybe a better way to write the if statement would be to write an argument like sys.date == birthday in which case, if the system date of the computer matches the object birthday, you would get extra text. Finally, if you would like to collapse a vector of strings into a single string, use the collapse argument. str_c(c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; str_c(c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;), collapse = &quot;, &quot;) ## [1] &quot;x, y, z&quot; 14.2.3 Subsetting Strings You can extract parts of a string using str_sub(). As well as the string, str_sub() takes start and end arguments which give the (inclusive) position of the substring: x &lt;- c(&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;) str_sub(x, 1, 3) ## [1] &quot;App&quot; &quot;Ban&quot; &quot;Pea&quot; # negative numbers count backwards from end str_sub(x, -3, -1) ## [1] &quot;ple&quot; &quot;ana&quot; &quot;ear&quot; Note that str_sub() won’t fail if the string is too short: it will just return as much as possible: str_sub(&quot;a&quot;, 1, 5) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; You can also use the assignment form of str_sub() to modify strings: str_sub(x, 1, 1) &lt;- str_to_lower(str_sub(x, 1, 1)) x ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;pear&quot; 14.2.4 Locales Alternatives to str_to_lower() is srr_to_upper() and str_to_title(). Changing case is a bit more complicated then it first appears Different languages have different rules for changing case # Turkish has two i&#39;s: with and without a dot, and it # has a different rule for capitalising them: str_to_upper(c(&quot;i&quot;, &quot;ı&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;I&quot; &quot;I&quot; str_to_upper(c(&quot;i&quot;, &quot;ı&quot;), locale = &quot;tr&quot;) ## [1] &quot;İ&quot; &quot;I&quot; Locale is specified as a ISO 639 language code, see Wikipedia Sorting and Order are also effected by Locale Base R only applies the system Locale Using {stringr} adds a local= argument x &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;eggplant&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;) str_sort(x, locale = &quot;en&quot;) # English ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;eggplant&quot; str_sort(x, locale = &quot;haw&quot;) # Hawaiian ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;eggplant&quot; &quot;banana&quot; 14.2.5 Exercises In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions? What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA? paste() converts arguments to character strings and concatenates them. paste0() is the same function but slightly more efficent. The {stringr} they are equivelent to are str_c(). The major difference is the use of as.character() at its base versus {stingr}. The paste() and paste0() changes NA values to “NA”. In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to str_c(). The sep argument treats each combined string as its own output. Whereas the collapse aregument creates one large string object. Use str_length() and str_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters? str_length() provides the quantity of characters in a string. str_sub() picks out the beginning and end of out of a vector. If the string has an even number of characters, it will only provide the smaller of the string. What does str_wrap() do? When might you want to use it? str_wrap() uses the Knuth-Plass paragraph wrapping algorithm. Knuth-Plass algorithm. This is important when using typesetting services like LaTeX. What does str_trim() do? What’s the opposite of str_trim()? str_trim() removes extra white space between vectorized strings. str_pad() is the opposite which puts characters back into the string. Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c(“a”, “b”, “c”) into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2. z &lt;- str_c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, sep = &quot;, &quot;) z ## [1] &quot;a, b, c&quot; # Unsure on the second half of hte question. "],["matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions.html", "14.3 Matching Patterns with Regular Expressions", " 14.3 Matching Patterns with Regular Expressions To learn regular expressions (regexs) we’ll use str_view() and str_view_all(). RegExplain 14.3.1 Basic Matches The simplest expressions are pattern matching: x &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;an&quot;) NOTE: If you run this locally, the window that opens looks empty. In truth, it is printed “white” on “white” and therefore hard to read. The next step up in complexity is ., which matches any character (except a newline): str_view(x, &quot;.a.&quot;) The trick here is if “.” matches any character…what if we want to search for “.”? We have to escape the term by using “\\”. Yet…this leads to another problem. Since “\\” is part of a string, we have to escape it twice. Therefore, it looks like this: “\\\\.”. # To create the regular expression, we need \\\\ dot &lt;- &quot;\\\\.&quot; # But the expression itself only contains one: writeLines(dot) ## \\. #&gt; \\. # And this tells R to look for an explicit . str_view(c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;a.c&quot;, &quot;bef&quot;), &quot;a\\\\.c&quot;) Good, we figured out how to search for periods (.) by using the escape character \\. Ok, but what if we want to search for \\? Hmmmm….we need to “escape the escape”. HA! Therefore, we need four backslashes! “\\\\\\\\”. x &lt;- &quot;a\\\\b&quot; writeLines(x) ## a\\b #&gt; a\\b str_view(x, &quot;\\\\\\\\&quot;) 14.3.1.1 Exercises Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \\: \"\\\", \"\\\\\", \"\\\\\\\". \\ doesn’t escape anything \"\\\" again, is a string and doesn’t escape anything \"\\\\\" escapes the escape, but doesn’t have any pattern to search for \"\\\\\\\" escapes the escape, but doesn’t finish the expression How would you match the sequence \"'\\? Unanswered What patterns will the regular expression \\..\\..\\.. match? How would you represent it as a string? Unanswered 14.3.2 Anchors By default, regular expressions will match anywhere in a string. However, if you want the beginning or end of a string, you can “anchor” the regular expression. Lets see how this works: # The following matches anywhere &quot;a&quot; shows up x &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;a&quot;) Intesting, I thought when searching for “a”, it would highlight every insteance of “a”. So “banana” would hit three times. Nevermind…str_view_all() is required to list ALL instances of a search term. # The following matches only the beginning of the string where &quot;a&quot; shows up x &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;^a&quot;) # The following matches only the end of the string where &quot;a&quot; shows up x &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;a$&quot;) To remember which pattern to use, remember the mnemonic \"if you begin with power (^), you end up with money ($). Evan Misshula x &lt;- c(&quot;apple pie&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple cake&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;apple&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;^apple$&quot;) 14.3.2.1 Exercise (Unanswered) How would you match the literal string “$^$”? Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that: Start with “y”. End with “x” Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using str_length()!) Have seven letters or more. Since this list is long, you might want to use the match argument to str_view() to show only the matching or non-matching words. 14.3.3 Character Classes and Alternatives There are a number of special patterns that match more than one character. - \\d: matches any digit. - \\s: matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline). - [abc]: matches a, b, or c. - [^abc]: matches anything except a, b, or c. Remember, to create a regular expression containing \\d or \\s, you’ll need to escape the \\ for the string, so you’ll type “\\\\d” or “\\\\s”. # Look for a literal character that normally has special meaning in a regex str_view(c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;a.c&quot;, &quot;a*c&quot;, &quot;a c&quot;), &quot;a[.]c&quot;) str_view(c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;a.c&quot;, &quot;a*c&quot;, &quot;a c&quot;), &quot;.[*]c&quot;) str_view(c(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;a.c&quot;, &quot;a*c&quot;, &quot;a c&quot;), &quot;a[ ]&quot;) This works for most (but not all) regex metacharacters: $ . | ? * + ( ) [ {. Unfortunately, a few characters have special meaning even inside a character class and must be handled with backslash escapes: ] \\ ^ and -. You can also use alternation to pick between one or more alternative patterns. If precedence ever gets confusing, use parentheses to make it clear what you want: str_view(c(&quot;grey&quot;, &quot;gray&quot;), &quot;gr(e|a)y&quot;) 14.3.3.1 Exercise (Unanswered) Create regular expressions to find all words that: Start with a vowel. That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.) End with ed, but not with eed. End with ing or ise. Empirically verify the rule “i before e except after c”. Is “q” always followed by a “u”? Write a regular expression that matches a word if it’s probably written in British English, not American English. Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country. 14.3.4 Repetition Controlling how many time a pattern iterates is the next sequence of control. This can be accomplished with the following operators: ?: 0 or 1 +: 1 or more *: 0 or more x &lt;- &quot;1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII&quot; str_view(x, &quot;CC?&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;CC+&quot;) str_view(x, &#39;C[LX]+&#39;) The precedence of these operators is high which means most uses will need parentheses, like bana(na)+. You can also specify the number of matches precisely: {n}: exactly n {n,}: n or more {,m}: at most m {n,m}: between n and m str_view(x, &quot;C{2}&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;C{2,}&quot;) str_view(x, &quot;C{2,3}&quot;) By default, these form of searches are greedy, which matches the longest string possible. To make them lazy (searching for the shortest string), you can add ? at the end. str_view(x, &#39;C{2,3}?&#39;) str_view(x, &#39;C[LX]+?&#39;) 14.3.4.1 Exercises (Unanswered) Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form. Describe in words what these regular expressions match: (read carefully to see if I’m using a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.) ^.*$ \"\\\\{.+\\\\}\" \\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \"\\\\\\\\{4}\" Create regular expressions to find all words that: Start with three consonants. Have three or more vowels in a row. c.. Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row. Solve the beginner regexp crosswords at https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner. 14.3.5 Grouping and Backreferences Parentheses also create a numbered capturing group. A capturing group stores the part of the string matched by the part of the regular expression inside the parentheses -You can refer to the same text as previously matched by a capturing group with backreferences For example, the following regular expression finds all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters. str_view(fruit, &quot;(..)\\\\1&quot;, match = TRUE) Dumb question…how does the R Environment know the object fruit? Use the command data() in Console to see all listed datasets in BaseR as well as those included in your loaded packages. For example, fruit is a dataset included with {stringr}. 14.3.5.1 Exercises (Unanswered) Describe, in words, what these expressions will match: (.)\\1\\1 \"(.)(.)\\\\2\\\\1\" (..)\\1 \"(.).\\\\1.\\\\1\" \"(.)(.)(.).*\\\\3\\\\2\\\\1\" Construct regular expressions to match words that: Start and end with the same character. Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. “church” contains “ch” repeated twice.) Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. “eleven” contains three “e”s.) "],["tools.html", "14.4 Tools", " 14.4 Tools In this section you’ll learn a wide array of stringr functions that let you: Determine which strings match a pattern Find the positions of matches Extract the content of matches Replace matches with new values Split a string based on a match A word of caution before we continue: because regular expressions are so powerful, it’s easy to try and solve every problem with a single regular expression. In the words of Jamie Zawinski: Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems. Exluded unbelievable long expression from presentation! Instead of creating one complex regular expression, it’s often easier to write a series of simpler regexs Quick story: I use regex at work to grep HTML for particular tags. Although I can do ctrl+f…I’d have to do it 1000s of times. Instead, I pass a recursive tag and iterate through the entire project. The process saves me HOURS! Break the problem down to smaller manageable chunks. Use a visual drawing if it helps to write out your expression. The point…don’t start from difficulty first! 14.4.1 Detect Matches To determine if a character vector matches a pattern, use str_detect(). It returns a logical vector the same length as the input: x &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;) str_detect(x, &quot;e&quot;) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE The use of a boolean output (True/False) means, we can count them! TRUE = 1 FALSE = 0 Makind functions like sum() and mean() useful. # How many common words start with t? sum(str_detect(words, &quot;^t&quot;)) ## [1] 65 # What proportion of common words end with a vowel? mean(str_detect(words, &quot;[aeiou]$&quot;)) ## [1] 0.2765306 When you create large logical conditions, you may be able to break them down to simpler search terms and then combine them together. Always try to start simple. # Find all words containing at least one vowel, and negate no_vowels_1 &lt;- !str_detect(words, &quot;[aeiou]&quot;) # Find all words consisting only of consonants (non-vowels) no_vowels_2 &lt;- str_detect(words, &quot;^[^aeiou]+$&quot;) identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2) ## [1] TRUE A common use of str_detect() is to match a pattern. You can do this with logical sub-setting or the convenient str_subset() wrapper: words[str_detect(words, &quot;x$&quot;)] ## [1] &quot;box&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;six&quot; &quot;tax&quot; str_subset(words, &quot;x$&quot;) ## [1] &quot;box&quot; &quot;sex&quot; &quot;six&quot; &quot;tax&quot; NOTE, the first example’s syntax is foreign to me. Would any member like to express what is happening? Filter is another tool that can make string detection easier. df &lt;- tibble( word = words, i = seq_along(word) ) df %&gt;% filter(str_detect(word, &quot;x$&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## word i ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 box 108 ## 2 sex 747 ## 3 six 772 ## 4 tax 841 A variation on str_detect() is str_count(): rather than a simple yes or no, it tells you how many matches there are in a string: x &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;) str_count(x, &quot;a&quot;) ## [1] 1 3 1 # On average, how many vowels per word? mean(str_count(words, &quot;[aeiou]&quot;)) ## [1] 1.991837 It’s natural to use str_count() with mutate(): df %&gt;% mutate( vowels = str_count(word, &quot;[aeiou]&quot;), consonants = str_count(word, &quot;[^aeiou]&quot;) ) ## # A tibble: 980 × 4 ## word i vowels consonants ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 a 1 1 0 ## 2 able 2 2 2 ## 3 about 3 3 2 ## 4 absolute 4 4 4 ## 5 accept 5 2 4 ## 6 account 6 3 4 ## 7 achieve 7 4 3 ## 8 across 8 2 4 ## 9 act 9 1 2 ## 10 active 10 3 3 ## # … with 970 more rows Note that matches never overlap. For example, in “abababa”, how many times will the pattern “aba” match? Regular expressions say two, not three: str_count(&quot;abababa&quot;, &quot;aba&quot;) ## [1] 2 str_view_all(&quot;abababa&quot;, &quot;aba&quot;) Note the use of str_view_all(). As you’ll shortly learn, many stringr functions come in pairs: one function works with a single match, and the other works with all matches. The second function will have the suffix _all. 14.4.1.1 Exercises (Unanswered) For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls. Find all words that start or end with x. Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant. Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel? What word has the highest number of vowels? What word has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?) 14.4.2 Extract Matches Use str_extract() to extract the actual text of a match Harvard Sentences length(sentences) ## [1] 720 head(sentences) ## [1] &quot;The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks.&quot; ## [2] &quot;Glue the sheet to the dark blue background.&quot; ## [3] &quot;It&#39;s easy to tell the depth of a well.&quot; ## [4] &quot;These days a chicken leg is a rare dish.&quot; ## [5] &quot;Rice is often served in round bowls.&quot; ## [6] &quot;The juice of lemons makes fine punch.&quot; Imagine we want to find all sentences that contain a color. Note…I’m changing this section from the British English form colour to the American English form. Create a vector of color names Then turn it into a single regular expression colors &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;) color_match &lt;- str_c(colors, collapse = &quot;|&quot;) color_match ## [1] &quot;red|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple&quot; Select the sentences that contain a color Extract the color to figure out which one it is has_color &lt;- str_subset(sentences, color_match) matches &lt;- str_extract(has_color, color_match) head(matches) ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; Note that str_extract() only extracts the first match. more &lt;- sentences[str_count(sentences, color_match) &gt; 1] str_view_all(more, color_match) str_extract(more, color_match) ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;green&quot; &quot;orange&quot; To get all matches, use str_extract_all(). str_extract_all(more, color_match) ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;green&quot; &quot;red&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;orange&quot; &quot;red&quot; If you pass the argument simplify = TRUE, str_extract_all() will return a matrix with short matches expanded to the same length as the longest. str_extract_all(more, color_match, simplify = TRUE) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;blue&quot; &quot;red&quot; ## [2,] &quot;green&quot; &quot;red&quot; ## [3,] &quot;orange&quot; &quot;red&quot; x &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a b&quot;, &quot;a b c&quot;) str_extract_all(x, &quot;[a-z]&quot;, simplify = TRUE) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;a&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [2,] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;&quot; ## [3,] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; 14.4.2.1 Exercises (Unanswered) In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem. From the Harvard sentences data, extract: The first word from each sentence. All words ending in ing. All plurals. 14.4.3 Grouped Matches Earlier we discussed using parentheses for clarifying precedence and for backreferences. ou can also use parentheses to extract parts of a complex match. noun &lt;- &quot;(a|the) ([^ ]+)&quot; has_noun &lt;- sentences %&gt;% str_subset(noun) %&gt;% head(10) has_noun %&gt;% str_extract(noun) ## [1] &quot;the smooth&quot; &quot;the sheet&quot; &quot;the depth&quot; &quot;a chicken&quot; &quot;the parked&quot; ## [6] &quot;the sun&quot; &quot;the huge&quot; &quot;the ball&quot; &quot;the woman&quot; &quot;a helps&quot; str_extract() gives us the complete match str_match() gives each individual component has_noun %&gt;% str_match(noun) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] &quot;the smooth&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;smooth&quot; ## [2,] &quot;the sheet&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;sheet&quot; ## [3,] &quot;the depth&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;depth&quot; ## [4,] &quot;a chicken&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;chicken&quot; ## [5,] &quot;the parked&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;parked&quot; ## [6,] &quot;the sun&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;sun&quot; ## [7,] &quot;the huge&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;huge&quot; ## [8,] &quot;the ball&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;ball&quot; ## [9,] &quot;the woman&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;woman&quot; ## [10,] &quot;a helps&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;helps&quot; (Unsurprisingly, our heuristic for detecting nouns is poor, and also picks up adjectives like smooth and parked.) If your data is in a tibble, it’s often easier to use tidyr::extract(). It works like str_match() but requires you to name the matches, which are then placed in new columns. tibble(sentence = sentences) %&gt;% tidyr::extract( sentence, c(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;noun&quot;), &quot;(a|the) ([^ ]+)&quot;, remove = FALSE ) ## # A tibble: 720 × 3 ## sentence article noun ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks. the smooth ## 2 Glue the sheet to the dark blue background. the sheet ## 3 It&#39;s easy to tell the depth of a well. the depth ## 4 These days a chicken leg is a rare dish. a chicken ## 5 Rice is often served in round bowls. &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 The juice of lemons makes fine punch. &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 The box was thrown beside the parked truck. the parked ## 8 The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage. &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 Four hours of steady work faced us. &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 10 Large size in stockings is hard to sell. &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 710 more rows If you want all matches for each string, you’ll need str_match_all() 14.4.3.1 Exercises (Unanswered) Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word. Find all contractions.

Why is it better to split up by boundary(\"word\") than \" \"? What does splitting with an empty string (\"\") do? Experiment, and then read the documentation. 14.4.6 Find Matches str_locate() and str_locate_all() give you the starting and ending positions of each match. You can use str_locate() to find the matching pattern, str_sub() to extract and/or modify them. "],["other-types-of-pattern.html", "14.5 Other types of Pattern", " 14.5 Other types of Pattern When you use a pattern that’s a string, it’s automatically wrapped into a call to regex(). # The regular call: str_view(fruit, &quot;nana&quot;) # Is shorthand for str_view(fruit, regex(&quot;nana&quot;)) You can use the other arguments of regex() to control details of the match: ignore_case = TRUE allows characters to match either their uppercase or lowercase forms. This always uses the current locale. bananas &lt;- c(&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;BANANA&quot;) str_view(bananas, &quot;banana&quot;) str_view(bananas, regex(&quot;banana&quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)) multiline = TRUE allows ^ and $ to match the start and end of each line rather than the start and end of the complete string. x &lt;- &quot;Line 1\\nLine 2\\nLine 3&quot; str_extract_all(x, &quot;^Line&quot;)[[1]] ## [1] &quot;Line&quot; str_extract_all(x, regex(&quot;^Line&quot;, multiline = TRUE))[[1]] ## [1] &quot;Line&quot; &quot;Line&quot; &quot;Line&quot; comments = TRUE allows you to use comments and white space to make complex regular expressions more understandable. Spaces are ignored, as is everything after #. To match a literal space, you’ll need to escape it: \"\\\\ \". phone &lt;- regex(&quot; \\\\(? # optional opening parens (\\\\d{3}) # area code [) -]? # optional closing parens, space, or dash (\\\\d{3}) # another three numbers [ -]? # optional space or dash (\\\\d{3}) # three more numbers &quot;, comments = TRUE) str_match(&quot;514-791-8141&quot;, phone) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] &quot;514-791-814&quot; &quot;514&quot; &quot;791&quot; &quot;814&quot; dotall = TRUE allows . to match everything, including \\n. There are three other functions you can use instead of regex(): fixed(): matches exactly the specified sequence of bytes. It ignores all special regular expressions and operates at a very low level. This allows you to avoid complex escaping and can be much faster than regular expressions. Note, I had to install the microbenchmark package before running the next code snippet. #install.packages(&quot;microbenchmark&quot;) library(microbenchmark) microbenchmark::microbenchmark( fixed = str_detect(sentences, fixed(&quot;the&quot;)), regex = str_detect(sentences, &quot;the&quot;), times = 20 ) ## Unit: microseconds ## expr min lq mean median uq max neval ## fixed 107.279 112.7585 127.4766 116.0515 118.7865 363.590 20 ## regex 347.883 348.6325 367.2353 360.2760 367.2910 535.542 20 Beware using fixed() with non-English data. It is problematic because there are often multiple ways of representing the same character. For example, there are two ways to define “á”: either as a single character or as an “a” plus an accent: a1 &lt;- &quot;\\u00e1&quot; a2 &lt;- &quot;a\\u0301&quot; c(a1, a2) ## [1] &quot;á&quot; &quot;á&quot; a1 == a2 ## [1] FALSE They render identically, but because they’re defined differently, fixed() doesn’t find a match. Instead, you can use coll(), defined next, to respect human character comparison rules: str_detect(a1, fixed(a2)) ## [1] FALSE str_detect(a1, coll(a2)) ## [1] TRUE coll(): compare strings using standard collation rules. This is useful for doing case insensitive matching. Note that coll() takes a locale parameter that controls which rules are used for comparing characters. Unfortunately different parts of the world use different rules! # That means you also need to be aware of the difference # when doing case insensitive matches: i &lt;- c(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;İ&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ı&quot;) i ## [1] &quot;I&quot; &quot;İ&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;ı&quot; str_subset(i, coll(&quot;i&quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;I&quot; &quot;i&quot; str_subset(i, coll(&quot;i&quot;, ignore_case = TRUE, locale = &quot;tr&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;İ&quot; &quot;i&quot; Both fixed() and regex() have ignore_case arguments, but they do not allow you to pick the locale: they always use the default locale. stringi::stri_locale_info() ## $Language ## [1] &quot;en&quot; ## ## $Country ## [1] &quot;US&quot; ## ## $Variant ## [1] &quot;&quot; ## ## $Name ## [1] &quot;en_US&quot; The downside of coll() is speed; because the rules for recognising which characters are the same are complicated, coll() is relatively slow compared to regex() and fixed(). As you saw with str_split() you can use boundary() to match boundaries. You can also use it with the other functions: x &lt;- &quot;This is a sentence.&quot; str_view_all(x, boundary(&quot;word&quot;)) str_extract_all(x, boundary(&quot;word&quot;)) ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;This&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;sentence&quot; 14.5.1 Exercises (Unanswered) How would you find all strings containing \\ with regex() vs. with fixed()?

"],["other-uses-of-regular-expressions.html", "14.6 Other uses of regular expressions", " 14.6 Other uses of regular expressions There are two useful function in base R that also use regular expressions: apropos() searches all objects available from the global environment.
