[["index.html", "R for Data Science Book Club Welcome", " R for Data Science Book Club The R4DS Online Learning Community 2021-03-29 Welcome This is a companion for the book R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This companion is available at r4ds.io/bookclub-r4ds. This website is being developed by the R4DS Online Learning Community. Follow along, and join the community to participate. This one is actually being developed ahead of the club by a private group, so don’t be confused if the book clubs don’t know about this version! This companion follows the R4DS Online Learning Community Code of Conduct. "],["book-club-meetings.html", "Book club meetings", " Book club meetings Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book. This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel.

Learning objectives: Describe a typical data science project. Explain the reasoning behind the order of content in this book. Recognize topics that are explicitly not covered by this book. Set up an environment in which you can learn the topics in this book. Describe how code in the book differs from code in your console. Recall ways to get help with R code. Produce a minimal reproducible example or reprex. "],["a-typical-data-science-project.html", "1.1 A typical data science project", " 1.1 A typical data science project The data science process Import: Get a data from a file, database, or web app into R. Tidy: Make sure each column in your data is a variable and each row in your data is an observeration. Transform: Filter your data to specific observations, mutate existing columns into new columns, and summarize data. Visualize: Visualization is an important component of data exploration, but usually isn’t very useful for automated processes. Model: Once you know what you’re asking, you can use a model to answer those questions. Models tend to scale well. Communicate: Communication is a critical part of data science! It doesn’t matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them. Program: Programming can aid the entire process, and unlock things that wouldn’t be possible to determine by hand. "],["the-order-of-content-in-this-book.html", "1.2 The order of content in this book", " 1.2 The order of content in this book Import &amp; Tidy are boring, so we jump to visualization &amp; transformation. After that we learn to wrangle (import &amp; tidy) data, because that is a necessary skill. Those baseline skills enables us to start programming. Learning to program helps us simplify the other steps. We might then get into modeling and communicating, or we might pick those up in books that are more specifically devoted to those skills. "],["not-covered-by-this-book.html", "1.3 Not covered by this book", " 1.3 Not covered by this book Big data: Working with big data is problem-specific. If you need to work with big data, other tools will be useful to learn. Python, Julia, etc: This book focuses on R. Master one tool at a time, but maybe go on to other tools later. Non-rectangular data: Honestly even a lot of things that aren’t naturally table-like can be coerced to be table-like, so it makes sense to start with tables. Hypothesis confirmation: This book focuses on exploratory data analysis.

If you can’t figure out what an error is telling you, copy/paste it into Google. Stackoverflow.com can be helpful, but beware. r4ds.io/join is a friendly Slack community with volunteer R tutors. When you ask for help, make a reprex if possible. State up front what packages you use (we’ll learn about loading packages very soon). Provide (a subset of) any data you use with dput(). Make sure your code is easy to read. Use clean spacing, clear variable names, and comments. #rstats twitter is super active and surprisingly friendly.

"],["loading-packages-in-r.html", "3.1 Loading Packages in R", " 3.1 Loading Packages in R Use install.packages(\"PACKAGE_NAME\") to install a package in R. You need to do this before you can use a package, but you only need to do it once. Depending where you’re learning R, the packages you need may already be installed. Use library(PACKAGE_NAME) to load a package in R. In general, you want to do this at the start of any session where you use a package. Alternatively, you can refer to a package every time you use it, such as ggplot2::ggplot(). “ggplot2” is the package, “ggplot()” is the function call, “::” tells R “look up this function in this package.” library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.3.3 ✔ purrr 0.3.4 ## ✔ tibble 3.1.0 ✔ dplyr 1.0.5 ## ✔ tidyr 1.1.3 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✔ readr 1.4.0 ✔ forcats 0.5.1 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() "],["first-steps.html", "3.2 First Steps", " 3.2 First Steps The {ggplot2} package lets us build up plots layer by layer. ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;): Set up a base plot with data. &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)): Add a geometry, such as a point (geom_point()). mapping: Map visual properties (x, y) to variables from data (displ, hwy). aes(): A function to do the mapping.
